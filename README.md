## Fast-Print the parameters of executable scripts

`params.sh` is intented to print all the arguments scripts in a certain folder accepts.

For example the call in this git-repository results in:

```bash
./params.sh
params.sh [FOLDER]
```

As you can see, the script params.sh accepts one optional argument `FOLDER`.
The output is taken from the parsed `usage()`-function. 
If the script does not accept any further arguments `params.sh` prints the message:

```bash
test.sh no parameters needed
```

At the moment `params.sh`does not determine, if the scripts in the folder contains a `usage()`-function.
